### About my self

I’m a kind of person who loves making games and has a lot of imagination that I need to express in order for me to be happy, I’ve been studying Information Technology and I am currently on my last years in college, My goal is to become a game developer where I can express my Ideas and see happiness in people’s eyes who plays my video games. 

My first interest was not really game programming but rather to become an artist, I love drawing characters when I was a kid and I just love how I see the things that are inside my mind when I draw them. Later I discovered animation, that’s when I had an opportunity during my senior high school years that I took the Animation strand which is my interest. Besides being artistic I also love writing stories which makes animation as my perfect fit. But then I discovered that computer programming was also one of the subjects there. And it amazed me so much that I all I thought everyday was about programming, and here I am again trying to find a canvas where I can put another art.

### My recent Projects

<a href="https://github.com/RJAmoto/DinosaurGame"><strong>DinoChrome</strong></a>
</br>
  This is something familiar, because it is the same game that you play whenever there is no internet... But I upgraded it and put colors on it and extra challenges. This is the first game that I made.

 This is a driving simulation game that can educate the user and by using the rules and regulation based on the Philippine traffic rules and regulation. Users will be educated by a quiz mode on the game which is also a reviewer if ever that they want to get a license. They may also test their skills using the actual driving simulation that incorporates real life scenarios in Philippine roads.
