### About my self

I’m a kind of person who loves making games and has a lot of imagination that I need to express in order for me to be happy, I’ve been studying Information Technology and I am currently on my last years in college, My goal is to become a game developer where I can express my Ideas and see happiness in people’s eyes who plays my video games. 

My first interest was not really game programming but rather to become an artist, I love drawing characters when I was a kid and I just love how I see the things that are inside my mind when I draw them. Later I discovered animation, that’s when I had an opportunity during my senior high school years that I took the Animation strand which is my interest. Besides being artistic I also love writing stories which makes animation as my perfect fit. But then I discovered that computer programming was also one of the subjects there. And it amazed me so much that I all I thought everyday was about programming, and here I am again trying to find a canvas where I can put another art.

When I first took college, the language that they thought us was Java. Which later became my foundation in studying game programming and even C#, I watched a lot of tutorials and read books about programming. Until such time that I thought maybe I could use my Artistic skills in programming, and that’s when I discovered game development which I found perfect for me to express my ideas.
